# YOLO Object Detection - Exploring the Future of Object Detection Analysis with YOLO v8

This repository demonstrates object detection using YOLO (You Only Look Once) version 8. The project focuses on applications across various domains, from traffic and vehicle analysis to PPE detection, quality checks, and public behavior monitoring.

## Overview

With the advancements in deep learning, object detection has opened doors to new applications and possibilities. This project showcases object detection analysis with YOLO v8, including multi-source streaming and area-based analysis, implemented with tools such as Ultralytics, OpenCV, Supervision, and Streamlit.

### Project Highlights

- **Model:** YOLO v8 for accurate and efficient object detection.
- **Tools:** Ultralytics (for YOLO implementation), OpenCV (for image processing), Supervision (for analytics and visualization), Streamlit (for a user-friendly interface).
- **Capabilities:** 
  - **Multi-source streaming:** Enables detection from various video sources simultaneously.
  - **Area-based analysis:** Customizable detection zones for focused analysis, useful in scenarios like restricted area monitoring or crowd management.

### Key Applications

1. **Traffic and Vehicle Analysis:** Analyze vehicle count, track types, and movement in traffic.
2. **PPE Detection:** Identify if individuals are wearing necessary protective equipment.
3. **Public Behavior Analysis:** Monitor crowd density and behavior in public spaces.
4. **Quality Control:** Detect anomalies or defects in manufacturing processes.
